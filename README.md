# PondBerry
The PondBerry is ready for action as a floating unit, which can take random pictures and then either upload or save them while also providing a live stream of video. I’m going to try make it as efficient as possible to buffer locally and then upload when the connection is available.  Here is my To-Do List list items with goodies I’m going to need:  3D printer for container / box Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi Camera and IR LED’s Water tight cable connectors from the box Power 5VDC or micro-USB Water Temperature sensors x 2 (top and bottom) PH sensor will be nice Wifi or 433MHz transmitter if a Raspberry Pi Zero
